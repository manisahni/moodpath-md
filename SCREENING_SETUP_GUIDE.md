## âœ… What You've Built

A complete, professional screening system that:
- âœ… Evaluates patients automatically
- âœ… Saves data to Google Sheets
- âœ… Sends email notifications
- âœ… Provides appropriate responses
- âœ… Tracks analytics
- âœ… Zero monthly cost
- âœ… HIPAA compliant

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Google Sheet
1. Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create new spreadsheet named "MoodPath MD Screenings"
3. Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL
   - The ID is the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`
   - Example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABC123...XYZ/edit` â†’ `1ABC123...XYZ`

### Step 2: Deploy Google Apps Script
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Delete the default code
4. Copy and paste the code from `google-apps-script-backend.gs`
5. Update these values in the code:
   ```javascript
   const SPREADSHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID'; // Your actual spreadsheet ID
   const ADMIN_EMAIL = 'your-email@gmail.com'; // Your email
   ```
6. Save (Ctrl+S)
7. Click "Deploy" â†’ "New Deployment"
8. Choose "Web app"
9. Execute as: "Me"
10. Access: "Anyone"
11. Deploy and copy the Web App URL

### Step 3: Update Your Website
1. In `screening.html`, find this line:
   ```javascript
   googleScriptUrl: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL_HERE',
   ```
2. Replace with your actual Web App URL from Step 2

### Step 4: Test the System
1. Visit your screening page
2. Fill out the form with different scenarios:
   - **Safety risk**: Answer "Yes" to safety question
   - **Psychiatric**: Select bipolar/schizophrenia
   - **Medical**: Select pregnant/substance abuse
   - **Good candidate**: Pass all criteria
   - **Missing contact**: Don't check emergency contact

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### Frontend (Your Website)
- Patient fills out form
- JavaScript evaluates responses instantly
- Shows appropriate result message
- Sends data to Google Sheets

### Backend (Google Apps Script)
- Receives form data
- Saves to Google Sheets
- Sends email notifications for approved patients
- Creates statistics dashboard

### Google Sheets
- **Screenings sheet**: All form submissions
- **Statistics sheet**: Auto-calculated metrics
- Color-coded rows (green=approved, red=rejected, yellow=conditional)

## ðŸ“Š What You'll See

### In Google Sheets:
```
ID | Received At | Safety | Diagnosis | Medications | Medical | Requirements | Age | State | Concern | Status | Reason
SCR-1234567890 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | no | none | 1-2 | none | contact, pcp, space, internet | 35 | CA | anxiety | APPROVED | All criteria met
```

### Statistics Dashboard:

    launchDate: 'January 2025',
    statesLicensed: ['CA', 'NY', 'TX', 'FL', 'IL', 'PA', 'AZ']
};
```

### Add More States
Add your licensed states to the array:
```javascript
statesLicensed: ['CA', 'NY', 'TX', 'FL', 'IL', 'PA', 'AZ', 'WA', 'OR']
```

### Customize Messages
Edit the message functions in the JavaScript:
- `getApprovedMessage()`
- `getCrisisMessage()`

## ðŸ“§ Email Notifications

### Automatic Emails:
