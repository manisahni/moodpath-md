                                Mild to moderate depression is most often first evaluated and managed by internists and primary care doctors. 
                                That's the standard of care. At MoodPath MD, we take that medical foundation further—with more time, 
                                targeted labs, and genetic testing—to guide treatment more precisely. For more complex cases, 
                                we collaborate with psychiatry when needed.

                                Yes. PCPs often have limited time (15-minute visits), and psychiatrists may not review your full medical picture. 
                                We combine both: internist expertise + psychiatric care + genetics to guide safer, faster treatment. 
                                Our 90-minute initial consultation allows us to thoroughly understand your situation.

                                In large studies, genetic-guided prescribing improved response and remission rates compared to standard 
                                trial-and-error. Results vary, but this approach gives us more clarity from the start, often reducing 
                                the time to find an effective medication from months to weeks.

                                We focus on low mood, dysthymia, and mild to moderate depression. We also address related concerns like 
                                anxiety that often accompanies depression. We use medical expertise to rule out underlying causes 
                                like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies.

                                Most patients complete labs and the initial consult within a week, versus months of back-and-forth elsewhere. 
                                Visits are telehealth—no commutes or waiting rooms. Genetic testing can help you avoid weeks or months 
                                of trying medications that won't work for your body.

                                Labs are often covered by insurance when ordered through your PCP. Genetic testing is a separate

                                Your genes affect how you metabolize medications. Testing reveals which antidepressants your body 
                                processes normally, slowly, or quickly—helping predict which will work best and at what dose. 
                                This reduces trial-and-error and side effects.

                                No, it's optional. However, about 80% of our patients choose it because it provides valuable, 
                                lifelong guidance for medication selection—useful not just for depression but any future medication needs.

                                No treatment is guaranteed, but genetic testing significantly improves our odds of selecting 
                                an effective medication on the first or second try, rather than the fourth or fifth.
